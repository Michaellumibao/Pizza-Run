# Pizza-Run

Pizza Run is an app made in Grade 10 in Adobe CS6.1 All the code exists virtually inside of the .fla file. 
To show off the code, I have copied them onto .as files with the number corresponding to the frame# of the application. 

This is a test to get familiar with using Git and Github.

*Note that this was the first time I have coded.

The .fla file (opened in Adobe Animate) was too large to upload to GitHub
Here is a link to the download:

All other files are located in 'PizzaRunDone'
